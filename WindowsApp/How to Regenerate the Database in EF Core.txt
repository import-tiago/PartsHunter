If an existing database or migrations need to be reset, follow these steps:

Delete Existing Build Artifacts and Files:

Remove the following directories and files from your project:
/bin
/obj
/Migrations
Any existing *.db files (your database file).
Clean the Solution:

In your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio), navigate to Build → Clean Solution to remove temporary files and ensure a clean build.
Open the Package Manager Console:

Go to Tools → NuGet Package Manager → Package Manager Console.
Generate and Apply Migrations:

Run the following commands in the Package Manager Console:
	Add-Migration InitialCreate
	Update-Database

Verify the Database:

Confirm that the new database and schema are created as expected.

Notes:
Make sure your DbContext and entity classes are correctly set up before regenerating the database.
Use meaningful migration names instead of InitialCreate when adding migrations for clarity in version control.
If using a source control system, commit your changes to the migration folder after verifying the database generation.
